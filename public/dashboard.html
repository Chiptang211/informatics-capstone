                        <p>COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. It primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. Preventive measures like wearing masks and vaccination are crucial in reducing its spread.</p>

                    <p>This is a great resource that accomplishes a number of purposes. You can find a vaccination clinic, get a food worker card, learn about how you can protect yourself against Covid-19, along with many more valuable features. This website is organized into two sections, Latest News and the Services and Resource Directory. These sections help the user to stay up-to-date and protect themselves against infectious disease.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://pandemicpatients.org/home/covid-19-resources/">2. Pandemic Patients</a></p>
                    <p>This website creates a way for people to gain information regarding Covid-19, its symptoms, and the relationship between Covid and air quality/wildfire smoke. Furthermore, the website uses a horizontal navigation bar at the top of the website to separate key features. Some of the resources clearly outlined within this project include the Covid-19 Advocacy Center and Pandemic Legal services. The Advocacy Center is a platform for connecting Americans affected by Covid-19 with their elected officials. Pandemic Legal is a program focused on providing free or reduced cost legal services to those affected by the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov">3. Covid-19 Treatment Guidelines</a></p>
                    <p>This is a great resource for the general public, enabling them to understand treatment guidelines for Covid-19 in regards to different types of individuals. Treatment Guidelines are organized by type of individual. For example, treatment guidelines for nonhospitalized adults are organized into one section on the website. Whereas treatment guidelines for hospitalized children are organized within a different section of the website.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-drugs-treatments.html">4. Covid-19 Drug and Treatment Tracker</a></p>
                    <p>This website keeps track of potential cures and treatments for Covid-19, allowing the general public to be informed and up-to-date regarding the illness. Furthermore, it categorizes these potential treatment options by level of effectiveness and safety. Potential treatment options range from fraud and pseudoscience all the way to FDA-approved solutions.</p>

                    <p>Evidence-Based Resources, or EBRs, are published reviews of intervention evaluations and studies to improve health. This platform has organized the EBRs into various topics based on health conditions, health behaviors, population groups, settings/systems, and social determinants of health. Allows for a well-organized platform that the user can explore based on their interests.</p>
