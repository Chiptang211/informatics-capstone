# Project Documentation 
This project was created by a team of upperclassmen Informatics students at the University of Washington as part of the Capstone Project graduation requirement. We chose to create a platform in which health-conscious individuals can gain health literacy in regards to infectious disease by entering in a specific zip code. We originally planned to include data regarding Covid-19, RSV, and Influenza but later limited our scope to just Covid due to time constraints. We were able to map wastewater plants as well as create a graph representing Covid levels within that zip code for recent dates. We also created an algorithm to determine Covid risk level based on the data available to us. Furthermore, our feedback page is also integrated with our backend, allowing users to submit feedback about our platform and this data will be stored within the backend. Our about us page includes information about us such as our names and specific roles within the project. Refer to the API-DOC for specific documentation regarding API/Backend.

# Next Steps
This project has a lot of potential for growth, which is why we are transitioning to open-source. We hope future teams will pick up our project and continue to develop it. Some ideas we had for them would be to increase the number of visualizations and statistics/key metrics within the statistics page. Another kep aspect we planned to implement but did not have enough time for was including data for other common infectious disease such as Influenza and RSV. Furthermore, another aspect that can be developed is identifying certain areas and times within a year that a zip code is likely to have a major outbreak of COVID. This will help our users avoid these areas, or at the very least take heightened measures to prevent the spread of illness.
